# AWS CCP Notes

I passed the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam in 2021 with a score of 929/1000. While I was preparing for the exam, I created a ton of notes. I plan on taking the AWS Solutions Architect exam in a few months so I wanted to compile all my notes and resources into one source that I can go back to and reference. I also want to make this file public so that anyone can use this to help them prepare for both the AWS CCP and AWS SA exam.

# Resources I used
- Whizlab CCP Practice exams: https://www.whizlabs.com/learn/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-practice-tests/ (I paid ~$10)
- Whizlab SA Practice exams:https://www.whizlabs.com/aws-solutions-architect-associate/ (I paid ~$10)
- Udemy Practice exams: https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-practice-test/ (I paid $13)
- FreeCodeCamp video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hLmDS179YE&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org
- AWS White Papers

# Tips

I went into AWS having 0 prior eperience with it. My strategy was to learn all the foundational topics, including EC2, VPC RDS, and so on, and then slowly build from there. I started by taking a single practice exam and failed miserably. I got around a ~50 from a mixture of my background in IT and guessing. I then was able to identify knowledge gaps. I finished the entire FreeCodeCamp video before even attempting anymore practice exams.

If you are brand new to AWS as well, I highly recommend going through all of the White Paper and the FreeCodeCamp video listed above. Additionally, I don't think you'll need both sets of practice exams like I did. The Whizlab provided 4 exams, while Udemy provided 6 exams. I highly recommend Udemy's practice exams over Whizlab. They had better explanations and you et 2 additional exams. Lastly, I retook all of the practice exams multiple times until I got at least 90% on every single one consistently. All of this was what got me to a 929/1000 score.
